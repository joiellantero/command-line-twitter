# Offline Twitter

This project mimics the basic functionality of Twitter, i.e., posting a tweet, sending private messages, viewing your private messages, and viewing your wall. The application allows users to log in and out; however, once you log out, all the data associated to your account will be deleted except the posted tweets.
